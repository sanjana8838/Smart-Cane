# Smart-Cane

An estimated 253 million live with vision impairment. The WHO states that about 90% of this number live in developing countries. According to reports, India has an acute shortage of optometrists and donated eyes. Therefore there is a need for a product on the market that helps make the lives of the visually impaired better, easier and gives them more independence.
We have come up with what we call the ‘Smart Cane’, that is an upgrade to the regular support cane made for the visually impaired. Not only have we come up with a user friendly device, it also provides a sense of safety and security to guardians of the user at any time.

## Hardware Used
1. NODE MCU 
2. IR SENSOR
3. ULTRASONIC SENSOR
4. BUZZER

## Summary
Our project uses IOT technology along with simple embedded system to control sensors.
We make use of various sensors for an input and alert the user using a set of output components. 
Sensors like IR sensors and Ultrasonic sensors are used.
The IR sensor is used for line following option and the ultrasonic sensor is used to calculate the distance from an obstacle to alert the user.
We are using IOT to send a message to the emergency contact of the user in case of distress.
The output component used is a buzzer that alerts the user.
We have also made use of Google Assistant to make it more user friendly as the user can make use of voice control.
We have worked to integrate all these features together using a comprehensive code.
